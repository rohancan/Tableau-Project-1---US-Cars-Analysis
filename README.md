# Tableau-Project-1---US-Cars-Analysis

Objective Statement:
"To analyze the pricing trends and factors influencing the resale value of used vehicles based on a dataset containing information such as brand, model, year, mileage, and condition."

Inference:
"From the provided dataset, it appears that there is a diverse range of vehicles available for resale, spanning various brands, models, and years. Factors such as mileage, condition, and location may significantly impact the pricing of these vehicles. Further analysis can reveal insights into the relationship between these variables and the final sale price of used vehicles."

* Findings *

1. It can be inferred that the most popular colors of the cars are white, black & gray respectively.

2. The most popular car brand is Ford followed by Dodge & Chevrolet. More than 50% of the cars are Ford, about 17% of them are Dodge and 12% are Chevrolet.

3. We can notice that the average price of the cars in the US is $18767.67

4. There has been a huge increase in the number of cars between the years of 2008 to 2019 and in the year 2020, we can observe a huge decline in the number of cars. The notable decrease in the number of cars in the US during 2020 suggests a substantial shift in consumer behavior and economic activity, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. This decline may reflect factors such as decreased commuting due to remote work arrangements, reduced travel and leisure activities, and economic uncertainty leading to delayed or canceled purchases of new vehicles.

5. When examining the scatter plot, we notice a positive relationship between car price and mileage. This means that as the mileage of a car increases, its price tends to go down. In simpler terms, older cars with higher mileage typically sell for lower prices compared to newer cars with lower mileage. This suggests that mileage is a significant factor influencing the resale value of used vehicles.
